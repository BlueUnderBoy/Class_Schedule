Hello cyber-traveler!

Thank you for choosing this application! Please explore and give tips and feedback concerning errors, updates, uprades, features, and more. 
Your time is truly appreciated. 

In this application you will find prompts and information pertaining to education and schooling. Navigate through the prompt and find out the 
type of classes you are required to take for your respective school and grade level. The prompt will start off by asking for some personal 
information like your name, birthday, and location. Then it will tailor a personal profile for you and generate the class topics that you 
are to take for the upcoming school year. 

Spread the word and let your friends know to sign-up and be better prepared for the school year!

To get the prompt started please execute the command "ruby welcome.rb"
To run a mini test please execute the command "ruby test/test_student.rb"

IMPORTANT: Please also note that when entering an answer for the grade level that you may have to put quotations around it! (i.e "9" , "freshman", "kindergarten")
